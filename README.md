# Developer's Note

    > I just made this game with my friends. There's not really a clear goal for this or anything. We just treated is as a form of learning exercise for making a games and for learning different types of programming languages. I don't know if I or we have time to update this in the future but we accounted for that. I mean, we posted this here on github, I'm pretty sure someone out there might take an interest and further develop this game. If that happens, I'm more than happy for them to continue this (and maybe give me a slight hax on their gacha game **wink**) with credits or not. Anyways, enough talking, back to maintaining.
